# ðŸ“Š Birthday Paradox â€“ Statistics 110 Projects

This repository contains Python implementations related to the **Birthday Paradox**, inspired by *Statistics 110: Introduction to Probability* by Harvard University (Prof. Joe Blitzstein).

## ðŸ”¢ Files

- `birthday_paradox_probability.py`  
  A Python script that takes `k` as input (number of people in a room) and prints the probability that at least two share a birthday.

- `birthday_paradox_plot.py`  
  A script that plots the probability of shared birthdays as `k` increases (e.g., from 1 to 100 people).

## ðŸ“ˆ Concepts Demonstrated

- Basic combinatorics
- Probability theory
- Visualization using `matplotlib`

## ðŸŽ“ About the Course

I'm self-studying Harvard's [Statistics 110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110) to build a strong foundation in probability, which is essential for my path in **quantitative finance and data science**.
